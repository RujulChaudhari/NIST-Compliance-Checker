# NIST Cybersecurity Framework Compliance Checker

This project helps organizations assess their compliance with the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**. The tool allows users to answer a series of questions about their organization's cybersecurity practices and provides a compliance score based on their responses.

## üìñ What is the NIST Cybersecurity Framework?

The **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** is a set of guidelines, standards, and best practices designed to help organizations manage and reduce cybersecurity risks. It consists of five core functions:

1. **Identify** - Understanding the organization's environment, assets, risks, and governance.
2. **Protect** - Implementing safeguards to ensure the continued delivery of services.
3. **Detect** - Developing capabilities to detect cybersecurity incidents in a timely manner.
4. **Respond** - Establishing processes for responding to identified cybersecurity incidents.
5. **Recover** - Developing recovery plans to ensure resilience and continuity.

Each of these functions is broken down into categories and subcategories, which are assessed through the questions on this site.

## üõ† How It Works

1. **Answer the Questions**: 
    - The tool consists of 30 questions that cover key areas of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.
    - Each question is designed to gauge the organization‚Äôs implementation of a specific security practice.
  
2. **Scoring**:
    - For every "Yes" answer, the organization is considered compliant with that specific practice.
    - The compliance score is calculated as the percentage of "Yes" responses out of 30 questions.
    - The result provides an overall percentage of how well your organization aligns with the NIST CSF.

3. **Get Your Score**: 
    - After answering the questions, click on **Submit** to see your compliance score.
    - The tool provides a percentage score showing how compliant your organization is with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
